## Equity Markets

### Equity Risk Premium (Demand & Supply Model)

### Buffet Rule
The Buffett model, also known as the Owner Earnings model, is a valuation model for equities developed by Warren 
Buffett, the famous American investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. The model is based on the idea that the value of 
a company is equal to the present value of its future cash flows, and is intended to be a more accurate way of valuing 
companies than traditional methods such as price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios.

The Buffett model uses the concept of "owner earnings" to estimate the value of a company. Owner earnings are defined 
as the cash generated by a business that is available to the shareholders, after deducting all necessary expenses, 
including capital expenditures. The model calculates the present value of these owner earnings, using a discount rate 
that takes into account the risk of the business and the required return of the investor.

The Buffett model is considered to be a more conservative approach to valuing companies, as it takes into account the 
company's ability to generate cash flow and invest in growth, rather than relying solely on reported earnings. It is 
considered to be a useful tool for identifying undervalued companies that may be overlooked by traditional valuation 
methods.

### Yardeni Model
The Yardeni Model is a stock market valuation model developed by Dr. Edward Yardeni, an economist, and investment 
strategist. The model uses the ratio of the S&P 500's forward earnings to the 10-year Treasury yield to estimate the 
fair value of the stock market.

The model compares the forward earnings yield of the S&P 500, which is the inverse of the P/E ratio, to the yield on 
10-year Treasury bonds. The idea behind the model is that the fair value of the stock market is reached when the 
forward earnings yield is equal to the Treasury yield. When the forward earnings yield is higher than the Treasury 
yield, the stock market is considered to be undervalued, and when it is lower, the stock market is considered to be 
overvalued.

The Yardeni model is considered to be a cyclical model, as it takes into account the economic cycle and interest rate 
environment. When the economy is in recession and interest rates are low, the model suggests that the stock market is 
undervalued, and when the economy is in expansion and interest rates are high, the model suggests that the stock market 
is overvalued.


## Currency Markets

### Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

PPP is a theory that suggests that in the long run, exchange rates between two countries 
should adjust so that the cost of a basket of goods and services is the same in both countries, after accounting for 
exchange rate changes. PPP states that the exchange rate between two countries should be such that it would cost the 
same amount to purchase the same basket of goods and services in either country, after accounting for the exchange rate.

PPP theory suggests that if a basket of goods costs $100 in the United States, and the exchange rate is 1.5 US dollars 
to 1 Euro, then the same basket of goods should cost 150 Euros in Europe. If it does not, then there is an opportunity 
for arbitrage, and market forces should drive the exchange rate towards the PPP rate.

To calculate we follow the Long-Run Averaging methodology as proposed from McKinnon & Ohno (1990) (For the case rate in CPI, 
the average of the time period 1982 to 2000 is taken):
```math  
PPP = Average Exchange Rate * [(Foreign CPI[t]/Foreign CPI[average]) /(Base CPI[t] /Base CPI[average])] 
```
For the inflation adjustment, we take consumer prices (CPI) as well as producer prices (PPI) and take the average of
the two measures.

- Frequency: monthly frequency update in CPI/PPI, daily update in actual nominal exchange rate.
- Type: USD is taken as base currency and is therefore always "fairly valued" with a score of 1
- Valuation range: Valuation ranges of +/- 20% are considered as significant, +/- 10% are in "fair"

### Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)

The REER is a measure of the value of a country's currency relative to the currencies of its major trading partners, 
adjusted for inflation. It is calculated by taking the nominal exchange rate, which is the rate at which a currency 
can be exchanged for another, and adjusting it for differences in inflation between the countries. The REER is used to 
measure the competitiveness of a country's exports, as well as the overall level of economic activity.

The REER reflects not just the price of a single good or service, but the price of all goods and services that are 
traded in the international market. It can also be used as an indicator of a country's overall economic performance, 
as a higher REER can indicate that a country's exports are becoming less competitive and its imports are becoming more 
expensive.

A country with a rising REER may be experiencing appreciation of its currency, making its exports more expensive and 
less competitive, which can lead to a decrease in the trade balance and a decrease in the overall economic activity. 
Conversely, a country with a falling REER may be experiencing depreciation of its currency, making its exports cheaper 
and more competitive, which can lead to an increase in the trade balance and an increase in the overall economic 
activity.

The difference between purchasing power parity (PPP) and the real effective exchange rate (REER) is that PPP is a 
theoretical concept that compares the relative purchasing power of different currencies, while the REER is a measure 
of how the value of a currency changes against a basket of other currencies.

### Yield-Spread Momentum (IR Spread Momentum)

A significant part of the relative value of currency markets comes from the interest rate differential. Financial
have been shown to only slowly price in new information (momentum theory). The same is true with fast relative yield 
changes. Measuring the momentum on the 2y interest rate differential can therefore be seen as an indicator of valuation
of a fx cross.


## Interest Rate Markets

### Taylor Rule
The Taylor rule is a monetary policy rule that describes how the central bank of a country (such as the Federal 
Reserve in the United States) should adjust its benchmark interest rate in response to changes in inflation and 
economic activity. The rule was first proposed by economist John Taylor in 1993 and has since been widely adopted by 
central banks around the world.

The Taylor rule is based on the idea that the central bank should adjust interest rates to stabilize the economy by 
keeping inflation near a target level and keeping output near its potential level. The rule is typically specified 
mathematically as:
```math 
i = r* + π* + (π - π*) + (y - y*)
```

The rule states that the central bank should adjust the interest rate based on the deviation of inflation and output 
from their respective target levels. If inflation is above target, the central bank should raise interest rates, if 
it is below target, it should lower interest rates. Similarly, if output is above its potential level, the central 
bank should raise interest rates, if it is below, it should lower interest rates.
